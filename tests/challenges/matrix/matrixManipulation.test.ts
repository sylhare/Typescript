/**
 * Matrix Manipulation â€” Replace Rows/Columns of 3 Consecutive Numbers with 0
 * 
 * PROBLEM:
 * Scan for runs of length 3 in rows/columns and set them to zero without 
 * affecting detection within the same pass.
 * Similar to candy crush 2D but with no cascade or gravity
 * 
 * PATTERN: Two-pass algorithm - first pass identifies runs, second pass sets zeros
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m*n) - scan matrix twice
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(m*n) for marking or O(1) with in-place techniques
 * 
 * Replace rows/columns of 3 consecutive equal numbers with 0
